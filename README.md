# Notes of useful R codes for Social Network Science projects

My name is [Alejandro Espinosa-Rada](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/alejandro-espinosa(4ed72800-e02b-47a8-a958-640b6a07f563).html), and I am currently a PhD student in Sociology and a member of the Mitchell Centre for Social Network Analysis from the University of Manchester. This repository is some of my notes of some of the random stuff that I am interested that involve R, social networks, or statistics.

My own implementations would be collected in a **"comming soon"** package.    


```r
g <- erdos.renyi.game(sample(1:100, 1), p.or.m = runif(1))
```

```python
G = zen.erdos_renyi(10,0.1)
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install g++
```

\[
A = 
  \begin{matrix}\begin{pmatrix}x & y\end{pmatrix}\\\mbox{}\end{matrix}
  \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} 
  \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}
\]
