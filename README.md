# Notes of useful R codes for Social Network Science projects

My name is [Alejandro Espinosa-Rada](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/alejandro-espinosa(4ed72800-e02b-47a8-a958-640b6a07f563)/publications.html), and I am currentley a PhD student in Sociology and member of the Mitchell Centre for Social Network Analysis from the University of Manchester. This repository are some of my personal notes of some of the random stuff that I am interested that involve R. 

My own implementations would be collected in a **"comming soon"** package.
